    These are used to write words which coincide with html synthax like > and <
    example for paragraph tag if we write <p></p> we wont see this in webpage, so we have to write
    &lt;p&gt; where lt stands for less than and gt stands for greater than, these are called entities

    <pre>
        Whatever wriiten in this tag is wriiten as it is
    </pre>
    &copy;is for copyright symbol
    hello &nbsp; this is used for spaces as html ignores all spaces after the first one

    <blockquote cite=""></blockquote>
    <q> these tags are used to quote something and url can be wriiten in cite</q>

    <code>This is a code</code>
    <!-- usually use this in pre so as to give newlines easily
